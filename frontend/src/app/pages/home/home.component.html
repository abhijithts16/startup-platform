      <h2 class="fw-bold">Why We're Building This</h2>
      <p>
        Starting up is hard — and many game-changing ideas never see the light of day because of a lack of support.
        At Startup Platform, we aim to remove that barrier by connecting dreamers with doers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to foster an ecosystem where passionate individuals get the resources, mentorship, and backing they deserve.
        Every submission is reviewed carefully — not just for ideas, but for intention, integrity, and impact.
      </p>
